<span><video src="/giggledy-piggledy/wip.mp4" id="portfolio-video" width=320 controls></video></span>Giggledy Piggledy is an implementation of a traditional children's rhyming game.<br><br>
_**The clue in two words**_
A Giggledy Piggledy clue is two words like "ruby cot" or "angry father".<br><br>
_**The solution in two words**_
The solution is two words that mean something similar, rhyme, and have the same number of syllables. So the solution for "ruby cot" is "red bed". Ruby and red are both a similar kind of color and a cot and a bed are both things you sleep on. You could call an "angry father" a "mad dad". "mad" rhymes with "dad" and they both have one syllable.

Implemented in SpriteKit with in-app purchases using the standard MVC pattern.
