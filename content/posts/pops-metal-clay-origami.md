We'll be folding silver metal clay sheets into origami to be fired into solid silver origami!

This event is unstructured, so everyone will be doing their own thing (there's no class or instructional portion). There will likely be someone who can help out if someone gets stuck and needs a hand.

A big thank you to [Clay Factor Ceramics](https://www.clayfactorceramics.com) for hosting the event!

#### Some key points

* This event is geared for people with some origami background. If you're new to origami, please contact an organizer and we'll see if we can pair you up with someone more experienced. Or, start practicing :-)
* Silver clay is pricey, be prepared to spend $30+ on supplies.
* Silver clay will be fired over night, so pick up and polishing will be arranged for another day.
* Children must be accompanied by an adult at all times.

# Details
Be sure you are very comfortable folding a crane or lily from memory, since those are two basic models that have worked well in the past. Of course, your welcome to fold something else if it strikes your fancy, but consider it an experiment since metal clay is not paper.

The silver clay sheets we'll be working with are a bit like folding a very limp, thin leather or vinyl sheets and are 6cm by 6cm, so it's more difficult than standard origami paper. But if you go slowly and carefully you'll likely get something nice in the end.

You'll have ____ hours, so there's time for several models.

# Tips for working with metal clay
{{< post-image "/pops-metal-clay-origami/working-with-metal-clay" jpg >}}

* Don't get it wet. Someone tried this briefly and the metal clay started to come apart quite immediately.
* Keep vermiculite out of the spaces in your origami when preping it to be fired. Vermiculite is little granuals that support your origami during firing so it keeps it's shape.
* You'll be able to shape the origami some post firing. But keep in mind the silver is very thin and can break. Best to do as much shaping ahead of time as possible.
